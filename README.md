### Notes

For the time being, the automated upload of the README to DockerHub 
is failing, and the build action is as well (however, new images 
are still pushed).

According to [this issue](https://github.com/peter-evans/dockerhub-description/issues/319) 
for the respective plugin for GitHub actions, this might be related
to a change or issue in the DockerHub API.
